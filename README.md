## Token Classification using Bert

🎥 Easy Guide: Train BERT for Finding Keywords with NER!

📝 Ever wanted to pick out important words from sentences? Join me in this code where I'll show you how to use BERT for that! We'll focus on something called Named Entity Recognition (NER) to find these keywords. Plus, I'll teach you how to do this not only with ready-made datasets but also with your own custom ones.

🔍 Discover the magic of AI as we dive into this keyword-finding technique. With BERT, you can make sense of sentences and spot key words. From using existing datasets to your own unique data, I'll walk you through every step in a friendly way.

🔧 Ready to give it a try? By the end of this code, you'll have the skills to find important words like a pro. Whether you're new to this or already know a bit, this tutorial will help you confidently work with keywords using BERT.

🌟 Ready to turn sentences into goldmines of information? Just hit play and let's learn, explore, and unlock the power of BERT for keyword extraction. Boost your skills and become a keyword-finding champ! 🚀🔑
